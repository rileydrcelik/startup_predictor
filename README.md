## Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline focuses on preparing data for model training and includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing values.
   - Removed irrelevant or redundant features.

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Scaled and normalized numeric variables.
   - Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

3. **Data Splitting:**  
   - Divided the dataset into training and testing sets for unbiased evaluation.

For detailed preprocessing steps, see the Jupyter Notebook file.

## Models

The project explores several machine learning models, including:

1. **Logistic Regression:**  
   A baseline model to classify startup success.

2. **Random Forest Classifier:**  
   Evaluates feature importance and handles non-linear relationships effectively.

3. **Neural Networks:**  
   Implements TensorFlow to leverage deep learning for complex feature interactions.

4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**  
   Explores decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces.

Refer to the notebook for model implementation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Results and Analysis

The models were evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Key findings include:

- Random Forest and Neural Networks performed best in balancing accuracy and interpretability.
- Logistic Regression provided useful insights into key features but lacked predictive power.

Visualization of results and feature importance is available in the notebook.
